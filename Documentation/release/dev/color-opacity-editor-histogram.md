# New data histogram in the Color opacity editor

A histogram can now be shown in the opacity editor widget.

It is controlled by the following buttons :
* A checkbox to enable/disable the histogram display
* A button that highlights when the histogram is outdated and computes the histogram when clicked
* A checkbox to automatically computes the histogram if it is outdated
* A slider to control the number of bins of the histogram
