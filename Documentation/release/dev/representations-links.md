# Adding support for making links between representations proxy or properties

So far, the Link Editor allowed to create links for Views and Objects (ie.
pipeline sources) but Representations were not available. It is not the
case anymore: one can link representation proxies or representation properties.
For instance, one can link the Opacity property of two representations together
and then, when one is changed, the other is automatically changed the same way
and vice versa.
