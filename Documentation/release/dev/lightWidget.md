# Adding Light Widget
Additional lights now have their dedicated interactive widget
for easier light manipulation and visualization.
The widget shows up for scene light, it shows the type of light (positional, directional), the light position, the light focal point and cone angle (for positional), and the light color.
The widget allows to interactively change the light position, the light focal point and cone angle.
