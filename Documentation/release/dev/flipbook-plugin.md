# Flip Book plugin for persistence of vision analysis

We introduced a new plugin which creates a new toolbar which allows a flip book type
rendering mode: when the flip book mode is enabled every visible representations
of an active Render view will be flipped at each flip iteration step.
This mode allows to use persistence of vision to perceive differences between
several representations. Note that the SPACE key can be used to flip visibility manually.
