# Adding linear camera interpolation

A new camera interpolation has been added for the camera animation.
It interpolates linearly between camera position while the old one was interpolating positions with a spline.
This new interpolation is available in the animation view.
It is called `Interpolate camera locations (linear)`.
The old one was renamed `Interpolate camera locations (spline)` to avoid confusion.
